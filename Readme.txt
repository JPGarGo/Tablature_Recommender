The following documents are the main files for your revision:

1. Music_Prof_Recommender.html --> Final document with the detailed business case description.
2. Music_Prof_recommender.rmd --> R Markdown with the code and business case description.
3. Tab_Recommender_App.R --> R script with the functional Shiny App where users receive filtered recommendations.

The other documents are just support files for the main files to work properly.
- helpercode.R --> R script with the tab_recommendation function for the shiny app to work.
- ShinyPic --> Image for it to be displayed in the final html document
